The data can be collected with the following code:

bc. Monitor monitor = MonitorFactory.start("Label name");

"Java monitoring and management console":http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jconsole.html

h4. jmap

"Memory map":http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jmap.html

Checking heap histogram

bc. jmat -histo:live <pid>

h2. Exercises

General tips:

* Measure, don't guess
* Use <code>@Jamon</code> annotation to get better understanding of the problem
* Measure again after each change

h3. 1. Slow front page

Find out why the loading the front page takes so long and fix it.

Goal: Front page response time *less than 100ms*.

h3. 2. No throughput

Find out why the throughput doesn't increase as the number of threads increases and fix it.

Goal: Throughput of front page and stock page *over 500req/s*.

h3. 3. Stability

Site has had some stability problems in production. See if you can find out the cause.
